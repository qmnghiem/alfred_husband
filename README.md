mobile app to scan local grocery stores sales and suggest groceries list based on recipes from new york times

The user should have the ability to create household and share access to the household with other users.  Users should have the ability to modify settings for their household to include number of adult, children, allergy.  The deal tab should have the ability for user to share location or enter zip code to narrow the deals down to a list of stores. Users should have the ability select, save the preferred stores, and view the deals from these selected stores only.  The recipe tab should have ability for user to save recipes into favorites sections, to create their own recipes, or to scan for recipes based on an user-provided recipe url.  The recipe tab should have the ability to update shopping cart based on the recipes selected, and the number of people in the household.

For the store tab, can you import google map api to allow users to select stores looking at a map and select their stores?



Let's focus on simple project first:
